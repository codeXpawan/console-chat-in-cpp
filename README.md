# console-chat-in-cpp
It is my first project on networking in CPP using SFML.
Though it is not completely build but you can have a try.

To run the main file:
Step 1:
Clone the file from here by using following command:
git clone https://github.com/codeXpawan/console-chat-in-cpp

Step 2:
open the clone file using following command:
cd console-chat-in-cpp

step 3:
clone SFML file using following command:
git clone https://github.com/SFML/SFML

step 4:
run the following command to compile the main.cpp file:
g++ main.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-audio -lsfml-network -lsfml-system

A file named a.out will be created

Open that file using ./a.out
